        The time interval, in seconds, between expected records

        The time the seed value was generated as the number of
        seconds since January 1, 1970

        A seed value represented as a 64 byte (512-bit) hex string
        value

        The SHA-512 hash value for the previous record - 64 byte hex
        string

        A digital signature (RSA) computed over (in order): version,
        frequency, timeStamp, seedValue, previousHashValue, errorCode

        representations and not the string representations of the data

                will be all zeroes
            2 - Time between values is greater than the frequency, but
                the chain is still intact
